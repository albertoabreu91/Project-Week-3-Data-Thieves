Visualizing the Twitter API information\n\nNowadays, Twitter’s total number of monthly active users is around 326 million, where 100 million are daily active users with an average of 500 million twits

When talking about usage, almost 70% of the users use Twitter to read the news, making it the main focus of our study.\n\nFrom the Twitter API, using the Standard Search method, we gathered approx. 42 thousand twits using “refugees” as our filter and English as the language for the twits.

It is important to mention that the random variable location is made by the user when creating the account and in many repeated cases, the locations were not valid.
