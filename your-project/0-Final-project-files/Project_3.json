Visualizing the Twitter API information\n\nNowadays, Twitter’s total number of monthly active users is around 326 million, where 100 million are daily active users with an average of 500 million twits pe day, making it one of the most used social media platform globally. When talking about usage, almost 70% of the users use Twitter to read the news, making it the main focus of our study.\n\nFrom the Twitter API, using the Standard Search method, we gathered approx. 42 thousand twits using “refugees” as our filter and English as the language for the twits. Ww got the hashtags, user_name, the twit text, and the location from the last 7 days. It is important to mention that the random variable location is made by the user when creating the account and in many repeated cases, the locations were not valid. For this reason, we had to select a couple of countries like Turkey, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Canada as our main focus and all the USA states individually. The selection of the countries is based on the most popular locations in our dataset, so a little bit of art and science.\n\n### Data Wrangling\n\nThe process of data wrangling started with the main focus of fiding potential repeated rows, since we had to do two streaming request using the python library Twython Streaming method. After applyting methods to eliminate duplicates, we made sure that each observation was unique.\n\nMoreover, to answer the questions of this analysis, we had to clean the locations columns. With this random variable we had to drop almost 39% of our data due to Null values. Furthermore, we had to select, based on the information obtain, a list of countries were the number of twits was greater than 30 twits after grouping by countries and US states.

It is important to mention that the random variable location is made by the user when creating the account and in many repeated cases, the locations were not valid. For this reason, we had to select a couple of countries like Turkey, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Canada as our main focus and all the USA states individually. The selection of the countries is based on the most popular locations in our dataset, so a little bit of art and science.</p>\n<h3>Data Wrangling</h3>\n<p>The process of data wrangling started with the main focus of fiding potential repeated rows, since we had to do two streaming request using the python library Twython Streaming method.
